# draw some simple shapes
# hint! The order in which you draw is important
# change x and y to move him around
x = width/2
y = 25
w = 23 # make him bigger or smaller
h = w # distort by changing the h seperatly
bmi = 1 # body mass index
# a line takes 4 values the starting point and the end point
line(x - w, y + h, x +w, y+h)
# a ellipse always takes 4 values as parameter
ellipse(x, y, w, h)
# a point just two
point(x, y) # look he has a nose
# a rectangle also takes 4 values like the ellipse
# but draws from its upper left corner
rect(x-bmi/2, y + h, bmi, h)
# you can also draw free forms by using vertecies
